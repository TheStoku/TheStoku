Hi there, I’m @TheStoku and I like pizza🍕 Just joking, but... who doesn't like pizza?😄

I'm very glad to see you here!
This profile is in some kind of maintenance mode, so until it's finished, you will see only some older stuff. There might be even no updates at all, depending on my free time🤷‍♂️

I love coding in various scripting/programming languages. At this moment I'm providing support on VPS powered by CentOS (game servers hosting).

🛣️Roadmap:
- [x] Create this readme file.
- [x] Push most recent changes to the current projects.
- [x] Start a new project (.NET, Java or other).
- [x] Update GH profile and current projects.
- [x] Get more familiar with Git.
- [ ] Create Next.js+React+Material UI project - on my way!
